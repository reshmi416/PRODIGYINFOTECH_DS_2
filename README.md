# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to clean the data, explore relationships between variables, and identify patterns and trends that provide insights into the survival rates of passengers.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset provides details about the passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. This project focuses on:
- Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and converting categorical variables.
- Performing EDA to explore relationships between different variables and visualize important patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset was loaded from the Seaborn library. It includes the following features:

- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Prerequisites

To run the code successfully, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Data Cleaning

The following steps were taken to clean the data:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
    - Filled missing values in the 'age' column with the median age.
    - Filled missing values in the 'embarked' column with the mode.
    - Dropped the 'deck' column due to a high number of missing values.
    - Dropped rows with missing values in the 'embark_town' column.

2. **Converting Categorical Variables to Numeric**:
    - Used pandas' `get_dummies` function to convert the 'sex' and 'embarked' columns to numeric values.

3. **Standardizing Numerical Features**:
    - Standardized the 'age' and 'fare' columns using `StandardScaler`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Various visualizations were created to explore the data:

1. **Correlation Matrix**:
    - A heatmap was used to visualize the correlations between numerical variables.

2. **Pairplot**:
    - A pairplot was used to explore relationships between numerical variables.

3. **Survival Rate by Class and Gender**:
    - A categorical plot was created to analyze survival rates across different classes and genders.

4. **Boxplot of Age and Fare**:
    - Boxplots were used to visualize the distribution of 'age' and 'fare' across different classes.

5. **Survival Rate by Age Group**:
    - Bar plots were created to analyze survival rates across different age groups.

## Results

The EDA revealed several interesting insights:
- **Survival Rates**: First-class passengers had a higher survival rate compared to other classes. Women and children had higher survival rates compared to men.
- **Fare and Age**: First-class passengers paid higher fares. The median age varied across classes.

## Conclusion

The data cleaning and EDA revealed crucial insights into the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic. The analysis highlighted significant relationships between variables such as class, gender, age, and fare. These insights can be useful for further predictive modeling and machine learning tasks.
